## Deployment Guide  

1. **Create IAM Users in Account A**:  
   - Create `Bruce` with the required policies for cross-account access to **Account B** and **Account C**.  
   - Create `Clark` with full admin privileges across all three accounts.  

2. **Create IAM Role in Account B**:  
   - Define the `bat-license-to-put` role with the necessary permissions for accessing the **S3 bucket** in **Account C**.  
   - Ensure the role can be assumed by EC2 instances in **Account B**.  

3. **Configure S3 Bucket in Account C**:  
   - Set up the `contingency-plans` bucket with proper bucket policies for read and write access from **Account A** and **Account B**.  

4. **Validate Cross-Account Access**:  
   - Test the defined IAM roles and permissions to ensure users and services can interact as expected.
